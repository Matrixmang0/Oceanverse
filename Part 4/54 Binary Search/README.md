# Binary Search in Python

This repository contains two versions of the Binary Search algorithm implemented in Python:

- [Binary Search in Python](#binary-search-in-python)
  - [Binary Search (Iterative)](#binary-search-iterative)

  - [Binary Search (Recursive)](#binary-search-recursive)

## Binary Search (Iterative)

### Description

The iterative version of the Binary Search algorithm efficiently finds a specified key in a sorted list of elements. It employs a loop to repeatedly divide the search range in half until the key is found or determined to be absent.

## Binary Search (Recursive)

### Description

The recursive version of the Binary Search algorithm efficiently finds a specified key in a sorted list of elements. It employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by recursively dividing the search range in half until the key is located or determined to be missing.
