## Description

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This script allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a Caesar cipher with a specified key.

## Features

- Encrypt a plaintext message using a Caesar cipher.
- Decrypt an encrypted message using the same Caesar cipher and key.
- Special characters and spaces are preserved in the message.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Matrixmang0/Oceanverse.git
