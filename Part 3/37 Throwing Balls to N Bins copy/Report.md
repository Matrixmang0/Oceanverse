# Ball and Bin Simulation Results

I conducted a simulation of throwing identical balls into N bins until all the bins are non-empty, repeating the process 1000 times for various combinations of bins. The results are summarized in the following table:

| Bins | Balls Required |
| :--: | :------------: |
|  10  |       25       |
|  20  |       60       |
|  30  |      100       |
|  40  |      128       |
|  50  |      169       |
|  60  |      254       |
|  70  |      273       |
|  80  |      308       |
|  90  |      396       |
| 100  |      480       |
| 500  |      3120      |
| 1000 |      6201      |

From the table, it is observed that the number of balls required is linearly related to the number of bins. As the number of bins increases, the number of balls required to fill all the bins also increases proportionally.
