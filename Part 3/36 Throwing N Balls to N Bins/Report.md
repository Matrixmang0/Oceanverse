# Ball and Bin Simulation Results

I conducted a simulation of throwing N identical balls into N bins, repeating the process 100 times for various combinations of bins and balls. The results are summarized in the following table:

| Bins & Balls | Maximum Balls in a Bin |
| :----------: | :--------------------: |
|      10      |           3            |
|      20      |           3            |
|      30      |           3            |
|      40      |           4            |
|      50      |           4            |
|      60      |           4            |
|      70      |           4            |
|      80      |           4            |
|      90      |           4            |
|     100      |           4            |
|     200      |           4            |
|     300      |           5            |
|     400      |           5            |
|     500      |           5            |

From the table, it is observed that up to 30 bins and balls, the maximum number of balls in a bin is consistently 3. However, from 40 bins and balls onwards, the maximum number of balls in a bin increases to 4 and remains the same until 200 bins and balls and even beyond until 1100 bins and balls.
